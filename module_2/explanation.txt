Let's analyze each statement about \( X \), the sum of the faces when rolling two dice:

---

### 1. **\( X \) can only take values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.**
- This is **false**. When rolling two dice, the smallest possible sum is \( 2 \) (1+1), and the largest possible sum is \( 12 \) (6+6). Therefore, \( X \) can take any integer value between \( 2 \) and \( 12 \), not just \( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \).

---

### 2. **\( X \) is a random variable.**
- This is **true**. \( X \) is a random variable because it represents the sum of the faces of two dice, which is a numerical outcome of a random experiment (rolling the dice).

---

### 3. **The mean of \( X \) is 4.**
- This is **false**. The mean of \( X \) is not 4. When rolling two fair dice, the expected value (mean) of \( X \) is calculated as:
  \[
  E(X) = \frac{2 + 12}{2} = 7
  \]
  This is because the distribution of \( X \) is symmetric, and the average of the smallest (2) and largest (12) possible sums is 7.

---

### Final Answer:
- The only true statement is: **\( X \) is a random variable.**

To calculate \( P(10 < X < 20) \) for a continuous random variable \( X \) uniformly distributed on the interval \([0, 100]\), we use the probability density function (PDF) of the uniform distribution.

---

### Step 1: Understand the PDF
For a uniform distribution \( X \sim \text{Uniform}[a, b] \), the PDF is:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}, \quad \text{for } a \leq x \leq b.
\]
In this case, \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 100 \), so:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{100 - 0} = \frac{1}{100}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(10 < X < 20) \)
The probability \( P(10 < X < 20) \) is the area under the PDF curve between \( x = 10 \) and \( x = 20 \). For a uniform distribution, this is simply:
\[
P(10 < X < 20) = \text{Width of the interval} \times \text{Height of the PDF}.
\]
- Width of the interval: \( 20 - 10 = 10 \).
- Height of the PDF: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{100} \).

Thus:
\[
P(10 < X < 20) = 10 \times \frac{1}{100} = \frac{10}{100} = 0.1.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
P(10 < X < 20) = 0.1.
